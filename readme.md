# Conference Buddy

With larger conferences, especially, it's difficult to coordinate with people in order to break off into smaller
groups. It can also be difficult to find a travel companion or roommate. Conference Buddy is here to fix that.

## Running Development Version

The easiest way is to add it to [Laravel Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/homestead), which is what it's built on.

If you want to do it the hard way, you'll want the following:

* PHP 5.6.10+
* PostgreSQL 9.4.4+
* Composer

## Contributing

My current plan/ideas can be found on the [Coggle.it mindmap](https://coggle
.it/diagram/Vc4HBbdZts0H3COf/0198157145cf3d64af0b403bbd9b05fe7aae9fb212ec0a8bff27c28cc97ba871), feel free to check it
 out and ping me somewhere if you want to flesh a piece out and help build it.

 Once the API/core is built, I could also use help with frontends. I'm starting with web, but it would be cool to
 have mobile apps, too.

 I'd like to keep this as well-documented and organized as possible, so be sure to include PHPSpec (or similar *Spec
 stuff when dealing with other languages) and Unit tests whenever possible.
